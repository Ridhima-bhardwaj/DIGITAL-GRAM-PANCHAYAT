# 🚀 Project Optimization Notes - Digital E-Gram Panchayat

## ✅ Code-Level Optimizations
- JavaScript split into modules per role (`user.js`, `officer.js`, etc.)
- Firebase config extracted to `firebase-config.js` for reuse
- DOM manipulation is minimal and scoped

## ✅ Architecture-Level Optimizations
- Firestore structure is flat and efficient (`users`, `services`, `complaints`)
- Role-based dashboards are separated to reduce code conflicts
- Reused DOM IDs, classes, and event listeners to avoid redundancy
- Language toggle using simple class selectors for maintainability

## 🔐 Security Optimizations
- All dashboard pages protected via Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` and role check
- Firestore rules (assumed: `request.auth != null`) can be enhanced for strict access

## 💡 Further Improvements (Future Scope)
- Implement client-side caching to avoid redundant Firestore reads
- Minify JS and CSS for faster load times
- Move language toggle strings to a config JSON for i18n scalability
